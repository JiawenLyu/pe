# Bug Category: PHP Injection

# The logic of the case05.php is: 
# 1. The script uses `eval()` and passes the variable `something` which is get from user input to the function.
# 2. `echo ._$GET['something']` will print the value of `something`
# 2. There is no input sanitization for the input `something`, and the `flag` is a variable defined in the script.

# Exploit: 
# User can injection a php code into the script by setting `something` to `$flag`. The script `echo $flag` will run and flag will be printed.
