# Bug Category: CSRF Predictable tokens

# The logic of the case09.php is: 
# 1. The script defines a `csrf_token` in the beginning.
# 2. When user enter something in frontend, a POST request will be made to server. 
# 3. Script checks `data` and `csrf_token` are defined in the request body and the value of `csrf_token` equals to the pre-defined token. 
# If it is equal, then the update is successful.


# Exploit: 
# The `csrf_token` used to check is always the pre-defined one. Thus user can always set the token value in the request data to the value of predefined one. 
# Then it always can pass the check about token value.
