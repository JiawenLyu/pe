# Bug Category: Local File Inclusion

# The logic of the case03.php is: 
# 1. The script retrieves 'LANG' in POST request body.
# 2. The script access the files using `include()` function. 
# 2. By passing the file path to the function, the script can access the corresponding file in the same directory

# Exploit: 
# User can set the POST request body to {'LANG':'../lfi.txt'}, then the file can be read by the script.
