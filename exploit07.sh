# Bug Category: Execution after Redirect

# The logic of the case07.php is:
# 1. Redirect_url in the page wil always go to new page `case07-1.php`, but the flag is on the original page `case07.php`

# Exploit: 
# Run a curl command on the url to view the corresponding page and get flag from the server

#!/bin/bash

curl www.wsb.com/Homework3/case07.php
