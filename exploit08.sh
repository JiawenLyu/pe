# Bug Category: Reflected XSS

# The logic of the case08.php is: 
# 1. The user input `name`in the get request and the value of it will be used directly in functions in the script.
# 2. There is sanitization function in the script using str_ireplace, which will replace `<script>` patterns in `name` with ''
# 3. Value of `name` will be displayed when the script giving feedack to end user

# Exploit: 
# Reflected XSS is possible as the only sanitization function can be bypassed easily, such as using `<script >` instead of `<script>`.
# Exploiting the XSS attack to get the cookie by letting `name` has the encoded value of `<script > alert(document.cookie) </script>`
# This script will be executed in the response and the document cookie will be alerted.
