# Bug Category: Logic Authentication Flaw

# The logic of the case12/includes/protected_page.php is: 
# 1. The script checks whether the user made the GET request is logged in the system.
# 2. If the user is logged in and the `admin` parameter from the GET request is true, it can access the page.
# 3. Otherwises the access is denied. 


# Exploit: 
# The `admin` parameter can be set when making the GET request. User can register an account and log into it, the registered credentials need to satisfy the requirements. 
# Then user can login to the account and make GET requests to the protected page. 
# By setting the `admin` parameter to `true` in the request, user can escalate privilege to get the flag.
