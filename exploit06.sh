# Bug Category: Remote Code Execution


# The logic of the case06.php is: 
# 1. The script uses `shell_exec` function and the parameter `cmd_url` will be passed in the function is hidden in the script.
# 2. Attacker can modify the parameter by passing it in the request.
# 2. There is no input validation, as the output will be executed in `shell_exec` function.

# Exploit: 
# Execute system commands `cat /etc/passwd` in a post request to run the commands from a remote machine
