# Bug Category: Unvalidated Redirect

# The logic of the case04.php is: 
# 1. The script gets `redirect_url` from the parametered `redirect` passed by GET request.
# 2. The script does not have any validation of `redirect_url` and it will redirect to `redirect_url`.

# Exploit: 
# User can set `redirect` to `www.google.com` and the page will be redirected to `www.google.com`
